# Deployments

Some examples of deployment solutions can be found in the following repos:

* [now](https://zeit.co/now) - [ng6-now-example](https://github.com/UltimateSoftware.com/ng6-now-example)
* [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) - [ng6-github-pages-example](https://github.com/UltimateSoftware.com/ng6-github-pages-example)

Contributions are always welcome!

Also we would love feedback on having an `ng6 deploy` / `ng6 add-deployment <provider>` command in core!
